Things left to do: 

Stretch Goals

Using React Router v4 to build a React user interface, create the ability for a user to visit "/cart", which will render a Cart (or Checkout), component. -- Done

The Cart (or Checkout) component is different from your live cart preview component, but instead the page where users will fill in their info when submitting an order. -- Created a checkout component with a form to collect users basic detials 

Bonus 

You now have a new checkout page, and that very first component looks quite similar to our live cart preview component on the home page. The only difference is that it doesn't display the list of items and there is no button. 
????????? Collect info from user or display items in cart CONFUSED  ????

Find a way to reuse your live cart preview component on the checkout page but so that the list and button don't get rendered. 


Bonus 2

Add a <Miss /> component that renders a NotFound component for when a user visitings a path that does not exist in your app.
